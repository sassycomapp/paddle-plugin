# MCP Integration Coordinator

A secure integration coordinator that manages communication between MCP servers with human oversight and approval workflows.

## Overview

The MCP Integration Coordinator serves as a central hub for coordinating communication between the Generic MCP Installer and the Compliance Server, ensuring all actions require proper human oversight and approval.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Integration Coordinator** (`src/server.ts`)
   - Main HTTP server
   - API endpoint management
   - Event coordination

2. **Authentication Service** (`src/services/auth-service.ts`)
   - User authentication and authorization
   - JWT token management
   - Password hashing and verification

3. **Audit Service** (`src/services/audit-service.ts`)
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Activity tracking
   - Compliance monitoring

4. **AssessmentStore** (`src/services/assessment-store.ts`)
   - Promise-based state management system
   - Server communication coordination
   - Real-time updates

5. **Controllers**
   - Assessment Controller: Handles compliance assessment requests
   - Remediation Controller: Manages remediation proposals and approvals

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
HOST=localhost

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=kilocode_integration
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password

# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h

```

### Database Schema

The coordinator uses PostgreSQL for data storage with the following main tables:

- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `assessments` - Assessment records and results
- `remediation_proposals` - Remediation proposals and approvals
- `approvals` - Approval workflow records

## Usage Examples

### Requesting an Assessment

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/assessment/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "requestId": "assessment-123",
    "assessmentType": "compliance",
    "options": {
      "includeDetails": true,
      "generateReport": true
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-24T09:25:00Z",
    "source": "installer"
  }'
```

### Approving Remediation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/remediation/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "approvalId": "approval-123",
    "decision": "approved",
    "reason": "Security vulnerability requires immediate attention"
  }'
```

### Getting Dashboard Data

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Integration with MCP Servers

### Generic MCP Installer Integration

The coordinator integrates with the Generic MCP Installer to:

1. **Request Assessments**: Installer can request compliance assessments for installed servers
2. **Submit Remediation Proposals**: Propose actions to fix compliance issues
3. **Execute Approved Actions**: Execute remediation actions after human approval
4. **Track Status**: Monitor the status of all operations

### Compliance Server Integration

The coordinator works with the Compliance Server to:

1. **Coordinate Assessments**: Forward assessment requests to the Compliance Server
2. **Manage Approvals**: Handle approval workflows for remediation actions
3. **Track Results**: Monitor and track remediation execution results
4. **Maintain Audit Trail**: Keep comprehensive records of all activities

## Human Oversight Workflow

### 1. Assessment Request
- Generic MCP Installer requests assessment
- Coordinator validates and forwards request
- Compliance Server performs assessment
- Results returned to coordinator

### 2. Remediation Proposal
- Compliance Server identifies issues
- Generates remediation proposals
- Coordinator logs proposals for review
- Human oversight interface displays proposals

### 3. Approval Process
- Human reviews remediation proposals
- Approves or rejects actions
- Coordinator logs approval decisions
- Approved actions queued for execution

### 4. Action Execution
- Coordinator executes approved actions
- Generic MCP Installer performs operations
- Results tracked and logged
- Human notified of completion

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with expiration
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control

### Authorization
- Granular permission system
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- Audit logging for all access

### Data Protection
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with security standards

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

- Performance metrics tracking

### Logging
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Structured log format
- Log rotation and retention
- Real-time log monitoring

### Metrics
