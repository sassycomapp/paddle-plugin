'@lru_cache()' LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache is a decorator that saves the results of a function based on its arguments and reuses them when the same arguments are provided again. It's particularly useful for expensive operations or when you want to maintain a single instance (similar to a singleton pattern).

Reasons to Use Separate Factory Files:
    - Single Responsibility Principle:Each file has one clear purpose
    - Config handles settings
    - Factories handle object creation


## enums.py
contains the enums for the project
