## Prerequisites for Resuming Work

### External Dependencies
1. **VS Code Installation**: Complete VS Code installation and configuration
2. **Extension Installation**: Install all extensions from `extensions.txt`
3. **Environment Setup**: Python and Node.js environments properly configured
4. **Anvil Workflow**: Ensure compatibility with existing Anvil workflow

### System Requirements
- VS Code 1.60+ (latest recommended)
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Node.js 14+ with npm
- Git for version control
- Adequate disk space for backups

## Next Steps for Resuming Development

### Phase 1: Complete Testing Components (2-3 hours)
1. Fix `test-extensions.py` syntax issues
2. Create `test-python-node.py` for environment setup testing
3. Create `test-cicd.py` for CI/CD pipeline validation
4. Create `test-suite.py` for comprehensive automated testing

### Phase 2: Documentation (3-4 hours)
1. Create `docs/recovery-procedures.md`
2. Create `docs/system-requirements.md`
3. Create `docs/troubleshooting.md`
4. Create `docs/best-practices.md`
5. Create `docs/maintenance.md`

### Phase 3: System Enhancements (3-4 hours)
1. Create `enhancements/backup-mechanisms.py`
2. Create `enhancements/drift-detection.py`
3. Create `enhancements/health-monitoring.py`
4. Create `enhancements/rollback.py`
5. Create `enhancements/credential-management.py`

### Phase 4: Integration and Validation (4-5 hours)
1. Complete end-to-end testing
2. Validate all success criteria
3. Ensure Anvil workflow compatibility
4. Create final validation scripts

## Known Issues and Considerations

### Current Technical Issues
1. **Extension Testing Script**: The `test-extensions.py` has syntax errors due to massive extension list
2. **JSON Parsing**: Some configuration files may have formatting issues
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Needs validation on actual Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Simplify Extension List**: Focus on essential extensions rather than exhaustive list
2. **Modular Design**: Keep components modular for easier maintenance
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to reduce knowledge loss
4. **Testing**: Rigorous testing before production deployment

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. ✅ Complete VS Code profile export/import
2. ✅ Automated environment validation
3. ✅ Backup and restore functionality
4. ✅ Comprehensive testing framework
5. ❌ End-to-end integration testing
6. ❌ Anvil workflow compatibility

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
2. ✅ Robust error handling
3. ❌ Performance optimization
4. ❌ Security compliance
5. ❌ Documentation completeness
