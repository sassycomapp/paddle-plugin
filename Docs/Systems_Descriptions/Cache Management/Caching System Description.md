Anticipatory Intelligent Caching Architecture

3.1. Predictive Cache  
Zero-token hinting layer for anticipated context usage.  
  
3.2. Semantic Cache  
Adaptive prompt reuse layer based on behavioral context.  
  
3.3. Vector Cache  
Embedding-based context selector and reranker.  
  
3.4. Global Knowledge Cache  
Fallback memory leveraging persistent LLM training data or static knowledge bases.  

Persistent Context Memory (Vector Diary)  
  
This is the foundation for longitudinal reasoning. Instead of the LLM starting from scratch each time, it can:  
- Recall the last RBAC audit  
- Remember a recurring test failure  
- Prioritize flaky logic branches for Sentinel to re-inspect  
  
How to implement it:   
Use faiss or PGvector to store:  
- Prompts/responses  
- Test outcomes  
- Code diffs  
Agentic decisions ("This patch fixed permission leak...")  
  
Link this to your predictive cache system—so your Token Optimizer can prefetch insights based on past runs.

Vector Diary  
  - A local memory vault that stores test insights, code evolution, and past behaviors  
  - Enables token-efficient re-queries and long-term learning

I have added the CI/CD System finalized document to our collection and will use all finalized reports as context going forward.

## Intelligent Caching System Design for Your Agentic VS Code Environment

### Objectives

- **Reduce token usage and latency** by anticipating context needs.  
- **Reuse relevant prompts and data** adaptively based on behavioral context.  
- **Enable long-term, longitudinal reasoning** through persistent memory.  
- **Maintain simplicity, robustness, and modularity** aligned with your existing MCP and VS Code agentic setup.

### 1. Predictive Cache (Zero-Token Hinting Layer)

- **Purpose:** Anticipate upcoming context or queries based on recent interactions and prefetch relevant data without consuming tokens.  
- **Implementation:**
  - Monitor user commands and agentic workflows via KiloCode's memory bank.
  - Use lightweight heuristics or ML models to predict next likely prompts or data needs.
  - Prefetch and stage these insights in a fast-access cache accessible by MCPs.

### 2. Semantic Cache (Adaptive Prompt Reuse)

- **Purpose:** Reuse previously successful prompts and responses when similar contexts or tasks arise, reducing redundant LLM calls.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Store prompt-response pairs indexed by semantic hashes or embeddings.  
  - Use similarity search (via vector store) to detect reuse opportunities.
  - Integrate with KiloCode's MCP routing to transparently serve cached prompts when applicable.

### 3. Vector Cache (Embedding-Based Context Selector)

- **Purpose:** Select and rerank context elements (e.g., past prompts, code diffs, test results) based on embedding similarity to the current task.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use vector databases like FAISS or PGvector to store embeddings of:  
    - Prompts and responses  
    - Test outcomes  
    - Code diffs  
    - Agentic decisions and annotations  
  - Query this vector cache dynamically during agent workflows to retrieve the most relevant context slices.

### 4. Global Knowledge Cache (Fallback Memory)

- **Purpose:** Provide a fallback knowledge base leveraging persistent LLM training data or static domain-specific knowledge.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Maintain a static or periodically updated knowledge base accessible via MCP (e.g., MCP RAG server).  
  - Use as a last resort when predictive, semantic, and vector caches miss or lack sufficient context.

### 5. Persistent Context Memory — Vector Diary

- **Role:** Foundation for longitudinal reasoning and learning across sessions.  
- **Contents:**  
  - Historical test insights (e.g., recurring failures)  
  - Code evolution snapshots and diffs  
  - Agentic decisions and outcomes (e.g., “This patch fixed permission leak”)  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Store in vector database (FAISS/PGvector) linked to the predictive cache.  
  - Enable token-efficient re-queries and context prefetching.
  - Integrate with KiloCode's memory bank and MCPs for seamless access.

### Integration and Workflow Summary

- **KiloCode** orchestrates caching layers, routing requests to the appropriate cache or MCP server.
- **MCP RAG Server** acts as the Global Knowledge Cache.  
- **Vector Store MCP** handles vector and semantic cache storage and querying.  
- **Predictive Cache** runs lightweight anticipatory models or heuristics integrated into KiloCode or a dedicated MCP.
- **Persistent Vector Diary** is updated continuously by agentic workflows (e.g., test MCP, AgentZero) and accessed by KiloCode for context-aware reasoning.

### Best Practices

- Use **modular MCP servers** for each caching layer to maintain separation of concerns and scalability.  
- Ensure **cache invalidation policies** to prevent stale data usage.  
- Optimize embedding dimensionality and indexing for fast retrieval in vector stores.  
- Leverage **memory bank files** in VS Code for local context persistence synchronized with vector diary.  
- Monitor cache hit/miss rates via **MCP Logging & Telemetry MCP** for ongoing optimization.

This intelligent caching architecture aligns with industry best practices, reduces complexity by modular design, and integrates robustly with your existing VS Code agentic environment and MCP ecosystem.
