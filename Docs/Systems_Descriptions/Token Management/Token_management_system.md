Here is the updated **Detailed Implementation Strategy for the Token Management System** document revised to match the minimal, robust, and fit-for-purpose implementation plan we discussed, leveraging PostgreSQL with `pg_tiktoken`, integrated with MCP and KiloCode, and avoiding non-essential complexity:

#### Also resolve this TYPICAL issue:
Example:
Upstream error from Chutes: Requested token count exceeds the model's maximum context length of 131072 tokens. You requested a total of 133573 tokens: 86387 tokens from the input messages and 47186 tokens for the completion. Please reduce the number of tokens in the input messages or the completion to fit within the limit.

Proposed solution:
What this means about token management in your system:
Yes, this is related to poor token management or exceeding model limits.

Your input plus the expected output tokens together cannot exceed the model's maximum context length.

In your case, the combined tokens (input messages + completion) are slightly over the 131,072 tokens limit, causing the request to be rejected by the model's API.

What you can do to fix or improve token management:
Reduce the number of tokens in input messages: Trim or summarize earlier context or remove unnecessary data.

Limit the requested output tokens: Decrease the max tokens you ask the model to generate in one completion.

Use models with larger context windows: If available, switch to or request a model that supports greater than 131k tokens context (e.g., some models offer up to 200k or even 1M tokens).

Implement token counting and quota checks: Before sending requests, count tokens to ensure requests stay within limits.

Chunk or split long conversations: Break very long inputs into smaller parts processed separately.

In summary, the issue is that your system is trying to process more tokens than your current model allows, so improving token management by reducing input size, limiting completion tokens, or using a model with a larger context window is necessary. This is a common limitation in large context models and not necessarily a bug, but needs careful handling in your system design.

### Detailed Implementation Strategy for Token Management System

#### 1. **Token Counting and Context Window Management**

- **Token Counting in PostgreSQL:**  
  Use the `pg_tiktoken` PostgreSQL extension for fast, accurate token counting directly inside the database. This aligns tokenization precisely with OpenAI's models and avoids external token counting middleware complexity.  
  Example SQL function to count tokens:  
  ```sql
  SELECT tiktoken_count('cl100k_base', 'Your input text here');
  ```
- **Implement token counting module in MCP/KiloCode:**
  Wrap API calls and inputs/outputs to count tokens by querying `pg_tiktoken` from your application layer (e.g., Python).
- **Context optimization:**  
  While token counting is accurate, pruning or summarization of historical context should be handled logically in application or agent workflows to keep token usage within limits. Store contexts keyed by user/session in PostgreSQL tables.

#### 2. **Rate Limit Enforcement and Dynamic Token Allocation**

- **Rate limits stored in PostgreSQL:**  
  Use relational tables to hold token quotas per user or API key with time-bound periods (e.g., daily limits).  
- **Middleware or MCP-layer enforcement:**  
  Before a token-consuming operation, check the user's current token usage and quota from the database.  
- **Priority-based token budgeting:**  
  Implement allocation logic that assigns token budgets per request based on priority:  
  - High priority: up to 50% of remaining quota  
  - Medium priority: 30%  
  - Low priority: 20%  
- Requests exceeding allocated tokens can be rejected or delayed accordingly.

#### 3. **Token Usage Tracking**

- **Logging token usage in PostgreSQL:**  
  For every token-consuming API call or agent interaction, log:  
  - User ID and session ID  
  - Tokens consumed  
  - API endpoint or action  
  - Task priority  
  - Timestamp  
- Use atomic insertions to ensure accurate logging.

- **Periodic quota resets:**  
  Use PostgreSQL scheduled jobs or OS cron tasks to reset token usage counters per quota period.

#### 4. **Security Considerations**

- **Secure token storage:**  
  Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables or secret vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).  
- **Token revocation and renewal:**  
  Maintain revocation lists in the database and check before processing tokens. Automate token expiry and renewal workflows.  
- **Sensitive content filtering:**  
  Optionally sanitize input before token counting as part of preprocessing.

#### 5. **Integration Points**

- Integrate token counting and quota checks with:  
  - **Agent memory systems** — for context loading and token-aware operations  
  - **External APIs** (e.g., Brave Search) — wrap calls to count and track token usage  
  - **RAG systems** — optimize token consumption by fetching efficient info  
- Initialization and hooks during system startup to set quota limits and prepare tracking.

#### 6. **Verification, Monitoring & Reporting**

- **Command-line or API tools:**  
  Implement commands or endpoints to show token usage status and quota information.  
- **Automated tests:**  
  Build unit and integration tests for token counting, enforcement, and allocation logic.  
- **Lightweight alerting:**  
  Set up basic notifications (email, logs) on anomalous token consumption, using queries against PostgreSQL tables.

### Example File Structure & Responsibilities

| File Name                | Purpose                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/mcp/token-manager.js` | Core token counting, quota enforcement, and logging logic (interfaces PostgreSQL `pg_tiktoken`) |
| `config/token-limits.json`  | (Optional) Configurable rate limits and priority mappings if external config used |
| `db/token-usage-logger.js`    | Module handling PostgreSQL inserts of token consumption logs |
| `middleware/token-quota-check.js`    | Middleware to enforce token quotas on API calls or MCP tools |
| `Docs/IDE/Token_Optimization.md` | Documentation on token management and usage strategies      |

### kilo-image-blocker Extension Integration

- Integrate **kilo-image-blocker** explicitly in the input preprocessing pipeline **before** token counting, marking or stripping blocked image data so that token counts exclude unnecessary image content.
- Document its impact and usage in `Token_Optimization.md`.
- Optionally add configuration to toggle image blocking on or off as needed.

***

### Summary

This updated token management system is:  
- **Simple & robust**, leveraging PostgreSQL with `pg_tiktoken` for token counting and usage logging.
- **Integrated tightly** into your existing MCP/KiloCode environment.
- **Minimal in dependencies and architecture**, avoiding Redis/Mongo or external token counters.
- **Focused on essentials**: counting tokens reliably, enforcing quotas, priority budgeting, secure key handling, and straightforward monitoring.

If you want, I can help prepare sample SQL scripts, Python code snippets for token management, or middleware implementations aligned to this plan.
