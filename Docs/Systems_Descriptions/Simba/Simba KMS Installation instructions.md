   Simba Knowledge Management System (KMS) is an open-source, portable KMS designed to integrate seamlessly with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It is generally provided as a software package that you can install and configure to manage and organize documents and knowledge efficiently.

workflow for installing and configuring Simba KMS on your Windows 11 system:

1. **Download Simba KMS**  
   - Visit the official GitHub repository at `https://github.com/GitHamza0206/simba` to get the latest release or clone the repo directly using Git if installed:  
     ```powershell
     git clone https://github.com/GitHamza0206/simba.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the ZIP package and extract it to a desired folder.

2. **Prerequisites**  
   - Ensure you have Python installed (typically Python 3.7+), as Simba KMS is often run as a Python-based application. Download from the official Python website and install it if needed.  
   - Install required Python packages by navigating to the Simba folder and running:  
     ```powershell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Simba KMS**  
   - Depending on the version and your usage, configuration may involve editing a configuration file (often `config.yaml` or `settings.json`) in the Simba directory to specify storage paths, indexing options, and integration points for RAG systems.  
   - Set up environment variables if required, such as paths to your document repositories or API keys for associated services.

4. **Run Simba KMS**  
   - Launch the application by running the main Python script, commonly something like:  
     ```powershell
     python simba.py
     ```
   - This will start the KMS, often exposing a local web interface or API you can interact with for managing knowledge documents.

5. **Create Knowledge Bases / Add Documents**  
   - Use the provided interface or command line commands to add, index, and manage your documents and knowledge entries.

6. **Integration with Other Tools**  
   - Simba is designed to work with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks, so configure integrations as needed, for example, connecting it with AI or ML services you use, or deployment environments like Podman.

7. **Optional: Run as a Service**  
   - For more robustness, you may configure Simba KMS to run as a Windows service or in a container environment using Podman, enabling it to start with your system automatically.

This workflow centers on a straightforward, reliable installation and configuration for development or production use, emphasizing Python-based setup and flexible configuration for diverse environments like Windows 11.
