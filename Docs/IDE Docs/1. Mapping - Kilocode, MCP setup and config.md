# KiloCode MCP Setup and Configuration Architecture - Comprehensive Workflow Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed workflow plan for implementing the KiloCode MCP (Model Context Protocol) setup and configuration architecture. The plan addresses the critical issue where KiloCode is not properly detecting and utilizing existing MCP installations in the `.kilocode` directory. The plan covers the installation and setup of the Generic MCP Package Installer (KiloCode-customized version), development of the MCP Configuration and Compliance Server with a 3-step process, integration between servers with human oversight, compliance validation standards, testing procedures, and documentation updates.

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: KiloCode is not fetching the correct tools and MCP servers when required because the existing `.kilocode/mcp.json` file contains only metadata (descriptions and docsPath) but lacks the actual MCP server configuration that KiloCode needs to fetch and utilize the tools.

**Current State Analysis**:
- `.kilocode/mcp.json` contains only server descriptions and documentation paths
- Missing actual MCP server configurations (command, args, env variables)
- No integration with existing MCP servers like filesystem, github, postgres, brave-search
