### 3. Updated Load Balancing Configuration
Added token-management service to the load balancing rules with appropriate configuration:
- Strategy: round_robin
- Max connections: 100

### 4. Updated Circuit Breaker Configuration
Added token-management service to the circuit breaker rules:
- Failure threshold: 3
