# mcp.json updated

I have successfully completed the task of updating the .kilocode/mcp.json file to include all MCP servers documented in the Docs/MCP_Tools/MCP Details folder that were not previously included.

## Summary of Changes Made

### MCP Servers Added (11 total):

1. **brave-search** - Brave Search API integration server
2. **compliance-server** - Configuration compliance checking server
3. **easyocr** - OCR functionality using EasyOCR
4. **fastmcp_local** - Local FastMCP operations server
5. **file-mcp-server** - Filesystem access server
6. **mcp-installer** - Generic MCP package installer
7. **kilocode-installer** - KiloCode-specific MCP server installer
8. **playwright** - Browser automation server
9. **podman** - Container management server
10. **pytest** - Testing framework server
11. **snap-windows** - Windows window management server

### Key Implementation Details:

- ✅ **Preserved all existing MCP server configurations** (10 original servers)
- ✅ **Added new servers in alphabetical order** for consistency
- ✅ **Maintained consistent JSON structure** with "command", "args", and "env" properties
- ✅ **Included standard environment variables** (NODE_ENV, KILOCODE_ENV, KILOCODE_PROJECT_PATH, KILOCODE_PROJECT_NAME) where not specified
- ✅ **Applied server-specific configurations** including environment variables and special settings
- ✅ **Ensured proper JSON syntax and formatting** throughout the file

### Configuration Structure:

Each MCP server follows the standardized format:

```json
{
  "command": "executable",
  "args": ["argument1", "argument2"],
  "env": {
    "ENV_VAR1": "value1",
    "ENV_VAR2": "value2"
  }
}
```

The updated .kilocode/mcp.json file now contains **21 total MCP servers** (10 original + 11 new), providing comprehensive coverage of all documented MCP servers in the system. The configuration is ready for use with the KiloCode MCP ecosystem and maintains backward compatibility with existing setups.
