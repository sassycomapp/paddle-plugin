# Task Completion Report: Orchestration System Update

## Task Overview
This task involved ensuring that the orchestration system is correctly represented in the `C:\_1mybizz\paddle-plugin\.kilocode\config\services.yaml` file based on the documentation requirements.

## Documentation Reviewed
1. `AG2_Cline_Validation.md` - Validated the implementation of the Orchestration System using AG2 and KiloCode as replacements for PM2
2. `AG2 Complete Documentation.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the AG2 orchestration system, including architecture, deployment modes, and configuration

## Changes Made to services.yaml

### 1. Added AG2 Orchestration System Configuration
- Added a new `ag2_orchestration` service section with:
  - Three deployment modes: "pure", "lite", and "full" (default: "full")
  - Configuration for three agents: Researcher, Coordinator, and Analyst
  - Agent-specific capabilities and settings
  - Health monitoring and restart policies

### 2. Updated Service Dependencies
- Modified dependencies to make `ag2_orchestration` a prerequisite for core services
- Updated external services to depend on `ag2_orchestration`
- Added `ag2_orchestration` to the circuit breaker rules

### 3. Added Brave Search Service
- Added a new `brave-search` service in the custom_services section
- Configured for web search integration supporting AG2 orchestration
- Included proper health checks and restart policies

### 4. Created AG2 Orchestration Chain
- Added a new dependency chain `ag2_chain` that includes:
  - `ag2_orchestration`
  - `postgres`
  - `agent-memory`
  - `rag-mcp-server`
  - `brave-search`
- Defined proper startup order for the chain

### 5. Updated Load Balancing Rules
- Added load balancing rules for:
  - `ag2_orchestration` (round_robin, max 10 connections)
  - `brave-search` (round_robin, max 25 connections)
- Maintained existing rules for other services

### 6. Updated RAG Chain
- Modified the `rag_chain` to include `brave-search` for enhanced search capabilities

## Key Features Implemented

### AG2 Agent Configuration
- **Researcher Agent**: Information gathering, document analysis, knowledge base queries
- **Coordinator Agent**: Task delegation, workflow coordination, resource allocation
- **Analyst Agent**: Data analysis, pattern recognition, statistical analysis

### Service Settings
- Log level: INFO
- Debug mode: disabled
- Memory path: ./memory
- Max concurrent queries: 10
- Query timeout: 300 seconds

### Health Monitoring
- Enabled health checks with 30-second intervals
- 15-second timeout for health check responses
- Restart policy: on_failure with max 3 restarts

## Compliance with Documentation Requirements
The updated services.yaml now correctly represents:
1. The AG2 orchestration system as the replacement for PM2
2. The three deployment modes (pure, lite, full)
3. The three core agents with their specific capabilities
4. Proper service dependencies and startup sequences
5. Integration with existing services like postgres, agent-memory, and rag-mcp-server
6. Addition of brave-search service for enhanced web search capabilities

## Next Steps (Based on Documentation)
1. Complete AG2 installation for Node.js: `npm install ag2`
2. Configure logging system to capture orchestration events
3. Implement Scheduler MCP with proper job persistence
4. Test end-to-end orchestration with real agent workflows
5. Document production deployment procedures

## Files Modified
- `C:\_1mybizz\paddle-plugin\.kilocode\config\services.yaml`

## Task Completion Status
âœ… Completed - The orchestration system is now correctly represented in the services.yaml file according to the documentation requirements.
