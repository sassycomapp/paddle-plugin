# KiloCode MCP Server Configuration Requirements

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive configuration requirements for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers within the KiloCode ecosystem. These requirements ensure consistency, security, performance, and maintainability across all MCP server implementations.

## 1. Core Configuration Standards

      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production|development",
        "KILOCODE_ENV": "development|staging|production",
        "KILOCODE_PROJECT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/project",
        "KILOCODE_PROJECT_NAME": "project-name"
      },
      "description": "Human-readable description",
