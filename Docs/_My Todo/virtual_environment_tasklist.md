# Virtual Environment Restoration Task List

## Overview
This task list breaks down the comprehensive virtual environment restoration and consolidation plan into actionable steps. The plan spans addresses duplicate environments, inconsistent management, and integration issues.

## Important Notes on Task Execution

### Task Dependencies
- **Phase 1 (Assessment)** must be completed before Phase 2 (Consolidation)
- **Phase 2 (Consolidation)** must be completed before Phase 3 (Migration)
- **Phase 3 (Migration)** must be completed before Phase 4 (Integration)
- **Phase 4 (Integration)** must be completed before Phase 5 (Validation)
- **Phase 5 (Validation)** must be completed before Phase 6 (Cleanup)

### Execution Flexibility
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks within the same phase can often be done in parallel
- **Incremental Testing**: Test after major milestones, not just at the end
- **Rollback Ready**: Always be prepared to rollback to previous backups
- **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation as you go, not just at the end

### Critical Path
The following tasks are on the critical path and must be completed in sequence:
1. Create comprehensive backups
2. Create unified Poetry environment
3. Consolidate dependencies
4. Update all integration points
5. Run comprehensive validation
6. Remove duplicate environments

### Risk Mitigation
- Always test in a non-production environment first
- Make changes incrementally and test after each change
- Document all changes and decisions
- Keep rollback procedures readily available
