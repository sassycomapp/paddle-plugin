# MCP pytest â€” Implementation and Usage Instructions

Here is a **simple, robust, fit-for-purpose set of instructions for MCP pytest** and how to integrate it into your MCP system for testing MCP servers and tools:

## Overview

- **MCP pytest** is a framework and MCP server implementation specifically for testing MCP servers/services.
- It facilitates **systematic debugging, registration of test failures, and reproducing test cases** for MCP services.
- It provides tools to analyze pytest failures, generate debugging prompts, and verify MCP server correctness.
- MCP pytest usually includes:
  - An MCP server exposing pytest-related tools (available as npm package)
  - Python and JavaScript SDK clients for invoking MCP pytest services
  - Integration via `conftest.py` or test config to embed MCP pytest operations into your Python tests

***

## Step 1: MCP pytest Server Installation

- Install MCP pytest server via npm globally or use npx to run without installing:

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/mcp-pytest-server

# Or run via npx without install
npx @modelcontextprotocol/mcp-pytest-server
```

***

## Step 2: Integrate MCP pytest in Your MCP Testing Workflow

- Add MCP pytest as an MCP server in your MCP client config or IDE integrations:

Example JSON config snippet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pytest": {
      "command": "mcp-pytest-server",
      "args": [],
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "register_failure",
        "analyze_failure",
        "generate_debug_prompt",
        "clear_failures"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

- Alternatively run as an HTTP or stdio MCP server and connect your MCP clients accordingly.

***

## Step 3: Using MCP pytest with Python Pytest Integration

- Add a `conftest.py` file in your Python test directory to configure pytest to interact with MCP pytest server, usually by:

  - Initializing MCP pytest client sessions
  - Intercepting test failures
  - Registering failures and obtaining analysis results from MCP pytest tools

- Example basic `conftest.py` snippet (depending on actual repo):

```python
import pytest
from mcp_pytest_client import MCPPytestClient

@pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True, hookwrapper=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    outcome = yield
    report = outcome.get_result()
    if report.failed:
        # Connect to MCP pytest service and register failure
        client = MCPPytestClient()
        client.register_failure(report)
```

- This integration helps automate failure tracking and debugging via MCP.

***

## Step 4: Running Your MCP Tests with pytest

- Run your existing pytest test suite as usual:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

- On failures, MCP pytest server collects, analyzes, and assists in debugging those failures by serving insights or prepared debugging prompts.

***

## Step 5: Extend and Customize

- MCP pytest exposes multiple tools such as:
  - `register_failure`: Send failure info
  - `analyze_failure`: Get analysis or debugging suggestions
  - `generate_debug_prompt`: Create prompts for AI-assisted debugging
  - `clear_failures`: Clear stored test failure data

- You can extend your test harness to invoke these tools explicitly or as test hooks.

***

## Additional Notes

- The MCP pytest server is **production ready and actively maintained**, used internally and publicly.
- Works with both **HTTP** and **stdio** MCP transports.
- Provides both **JavaScript and Python SDKs** for MCP client integration.
- Enhances test reliability and developer experience by enabling automated MCP-enabled debugging.
