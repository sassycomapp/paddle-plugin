## MCP Logging and Telemetry Integration Plan for KiloCode + AG2 + MCP Setup

Here is a **simple, actionable integration plan** to incorporate **MCP Logging and Telemetry** into your existing system built on **KiloCode, AG2, and MCP** tools, focusing on simplicity, robustness, and resource efficiency

### Overview

MCP Logging and Telemetry is an MCP server designed to capture logs, trace tool usage, interactions, and token consumption from MCP tools and AI agents. Integrating it will give you an observability layer without heavy infrastructure while allowing you to debug, audit, and optimize your AI workflows.

***

### Step 1: Set Up MCP Logging and Telemetry Server

- **Obtain a lightweight MCP logging and telemetry server implementation** (you can create one using FastMCP or a dedicated MCP telemetry server if available).

- **Start the MCP Logging and Telemetry server** locally or on your preferred host.

- This server will receive telemetry events from your other MCP servers and agents, store logs, and expose telemetry data.

***

### Step 2: Configure Your MCP Servers and Tools to Emit Telemetry

- Modify or configure each MCP server (Simba KMS MCP, Podman MCP, FastMCP tools) to **emit telemetry data** for every tool call:

  - Log tool invocation, input/output size, token consumption
  - Record success/failure and latency
  - Send telemetry events asynchronously to the MCP Logging and Telemetry server

- If your MCP tooling or framework supports automatic telemetry hooks, enable them.

- If not, wrap your MCP tool handlers to include telemetry event emission after each call.

***

### Step 3: Integrate Telemetry Client into AG2 and KiloCode

- In your **AG2 orchestration code and KiloCode configuration**, register the MCP Logging and Telemetry MCP Server as an available MCP server.

- When MCP tools are called through AG2 or KiloCode, the telemetry server automatically collects interaction metadata.

- Use the same MCP client session approach you have for other MCP servers, connecting to telemetry MCP via `stdio`, `SSE` or HTTP transports.

***

### Step 4: Configuration in KiloCode

- **Add MCP Logging and Telemetry MCP server configuration** to your `kilocode_mcp_settings.json` or equivalent config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logging_telemetry": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/telemetry_server.py"],
      "alwaysAllow": ["log_event", "get_logs", "get_metrics"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

- Alternatively, if telemetry MCP server runs remotely via HTTP/SSE:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logging_telemetry": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8081/mcp",
      "alwaysAllow": ["log_event", "get_logs", "get_metrics"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

***

### Step 5: Add Telemetry Event Calls in MCP Client Middleware

- Wrap your MCP client calls in a **middleware or interceptor** that:

  - Before and/or after each tool call, sends lightweight telemetry events to the logging MCP server (e.g., tool name, tokens used, duration, success/failure).

- This can be a decorator or async handler in Python in your AG2 or KiloCode integration layers.

***

### Step 6: Basic Telemetry Usage and Reporting

- Use the MCP Logging and Telemetry server's API to **query logs, metrics, and trace data**.

- Build lightweight dashboards or CLI commands inside KiloCode to:

  - Monitor token usage over time
  - Track error rates and latencies per MCP tool
  - Audit user or session activity traces

***

### Step 7: Keep It Lightweight and Simple

- Avoid heavy external telemetry backends initially (like Prometheus, ELK) unless needed.

- Store telemetry data locally or on a minimal database (e.g., SQLite or lightweight JSON logs) inside the telemetry MCP server.

- Use throttling or sampling if telemetry data volume grows too large.

***

### Summary Checklist

| Step | Task                                    | Notes                                    |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Deploy MCP Logging and Telemetry server | Use FastMCP or similar lightweight server|
| 2     | Enable MCP servers/tools to emit telemetry events | Wrap tool handlers or enable built-in hooks|
| 3     | Register telemetry MCP server in KiloCode and AG2 | Add to config and MCP client sessions    |
| 4     | Add client-side middleware for telemetry event submission | Decorate MCP calls in AG2/KiloCode          |
| 5     | Use telemetry server APIs for monitoring and reporting | Build lightweight dashboards or commands |
